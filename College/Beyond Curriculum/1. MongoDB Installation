Experiment 1

Experiment 1: Write the steps to install and implement NOSQL databases MongoDB.

MongoDB Download and Installation Steps:

Step 1) Installing MongoDB
Open your browser and type https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
 

Step 2) Click on “Download” button.
 
Step 3) When the download is complete open the msi file and click the next button in the startup screen:
 
Step 4) Now accept the End-User License Agreement and click the next button:
 
Step 5) Now select the complete option to install all the program features.
 
Step 6) Select “Run service as Network Service user” and copy the path of the data directory. Click Next:
 
Step 7) Click the Install button to start the MongoDB installation process:
 
Step 8) After clicking on the install button installation of MongoDB begins:
 
Step 9) Now click the Finish button to complete the MongoDB installation process
Step 10) Now we go to the location where MongoDB installed in step 6 in your system and copy the bin path:
 
Step 11) Create Environment Variable.
To create an environment variable open system properties << Environment Variable << System variable << path << Edit Environment variable and paste the copied link to your environment system and click Ok:
 
Step 12) Running MongoDB Server
After setting the environment variable, we will run the MongoDB server, i.e. mongod.  So, open the command prompt and run the following command:
 mongod
When you run this command you will get an error i.e. C:/data/db/ not found. 
Step 12: Now, Open C drive and create a folder named “data” inside this folder create another folder named “db”. After creating these folders. Again open the command prompt and run the following command:
 mongod
Now, this time the MongoDB server(i.e., mongod) will run successfully.
 
Step 13) Running mongo Shell
Now we are going to connect our server (mongod) with the mongo shell. So, keep that mongod window and open a new command prompt window and write mongo. Now, our mongo shell will successfully connect to the mongod.
Important Point: Please do not close the mongod window if you close this window your server will stop working and it will not able to connect with the mongo shell.
 
Now, you are ready to write queries in the mongo Shell.
Step 14) Run MongoDB
Now you can make a new database, collections, and documents in your shell. The use Database_name command makes a new database in the system if it does not exist, if the database exists it uses that database:
use gfg
Now your database is ready of name gfg.
The db.Collection_name command makes a new collection in the gfg database and the insertOne() method inserts the document in the student collection:
db.student.insertOne({Akshay:500})
 
Learning outcome of the Program:
