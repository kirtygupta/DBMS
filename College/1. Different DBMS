EXPERIMENT 1: - STUDY AND PRACTICE VARIOUS DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS LIKE MYSQL / ORACLE / POSTGRE SQL/ SQL SERVER AND MONGO DB.
THEORY: -
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that allows users to create, maintain, and manage databases. It provides an interface between the end-user and the database, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. Some popular databases are MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, etc. DBMS provides many operations such as creating a database, storing in the database, updating an existing database, and deleting from the database. DBMS is a system that enables you to store, modify, and retrieve data in an organized way. It also provides security to the database. In this Database Management System tutorial, you’ll learn basic to advanced topics like ER model, Relational Model, Relation Algebra, Normalization, File Organization, etc.
MySQL:
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that enables users to store, manage, and retrieve structured data efficiently. It is widely used for various applications, from small-scale projects to large-scale websites and enterprise-level solutions. MySQL offers various features and solutions for different scenarios, such as data warehousing, data lakes, machine learning, and cloud applications. MySQL is available in different editions, including MySQL Heat Wave, Enterprise Edition, Cluster CGE, and other products and services.
FEATURES OF MySQL :
Open Source - MySQL is freely available and open-source, allowing users to view, modify, and distribute the source code as per the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Cross-Platform Compatibility - MySQL is designed to run on various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, and others, providing flexibility and ease of deployment.
Ease of Use - MySQL is known for its user-friendly interface and ease of use. Tools like MySQL Workbench provide a graphical environment for managing databases.
Scalability - MySQL supports both vertical and horizontal scaling, making it suitable for small projects as well as large-scale applications with high traffic.

ADVANTAGES :
Faster Query Processing – Large amount of data is retrieved quickly and efficiently. Operations like Insertion, deletion, manipulation of data is also done in almost no time.
No Coding Skills – For data retrieval, large number of lines of code is not required. All basic keywords such as SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE are used and also the syntactical rules are not complex in SQL, which makes it a user-friendly language.
Standardized Language – Due to documentation and long establishment over years, it provides a uniform platform worldwide to all its users.
Portable – It can be used in programs in PCs, server, laptops independent of any platform (Operating System,). Also, it can be embedded with other applications as per need/requirement/use.

DISADVANTAGES :
Limited Support for Complex Transactions - MySQL may not be the best choice for applications that require complex transactions and full ACID compliance, as it may face limitations compared to some other relational database management systems (RDBMS).
Lack of Features in Earlier Versions - Older versions of MySQL lacked some advanced features compared to other database systems. However, many of these limitations have been addressed in recent versions.
Default Configuration Can Be Insecure - The default configuration of MySQL may not be as secure as needed for production environments. Proper configuration and security measures must be implemented to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities.
Limited Support for NoSQL Features- While MySQL is primarily a relational database, it has introduced some support for NoSQL features in recent versions. However, it may not be as feature-rich as dedicated NoSQL databases for certain use cases.

ORACLE
Oracle Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that allows users to create, maintain, and manage databases.

MONGO DB
MongoDB is a source-available, crossplatform, document-oriented database 
program. Classified as a NoSQL 
database product, MongoDB utilizes 
JSON-like documents with optional 
schemas. MongoDB is developed by 
MongoDB Inc. and current versions 
are licensed under the Server Side 
Public License (SSPL). MongoDB is a 
member of the MACH Alliance. 
MongoDB handles both organized and 
unstructured data across diverse 
1.7
KIRTY GUPTA
applications. It seamlessly integrates with other popular programming languages and adapts to 
different tech environments without much effort.
FEATURES OF MongoDB :
NoSQL Database - MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it is designed to handle 
unstructured or semi-structured data, providing greater flexibility than traditional relational 
databases.
Document-Oriented - MongoDB stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON 
(Binary JSON), allowing for easy storage of nested structures and arrays.
Schema-less - MongoDB is schema-less, meaning there is no need to define a rigid schema 
beforehand. This allows for dynamic changes to the data structure.
Horizontal Scalability - MongoDB can scale horizontally by sharding data across multiple 
servers, making it suitable for large and distributed systems.
ADVANTAGES :
Flexible Schema - The schema-less nature of MongoDB allows for easy adaptation to evolving 
application requirements without the need for a predefined schema.
Scalability - MongoDB's horizontal scaling and automatic sharding make it highly scalable, 
suitable for handling large amounts of data and high traffic.
Document-Oriented Model - The document-oriented data model is well-suited for 
representing complex relationships and nested structures, making it easy to work with realworld data.
High Performance - MongoDB is designed for high performance, with features like indexing, 
query optimization, and horizontal scaling contributing to its efficiency.
DISADVANTAGES :
Lack of Transactions Across Documents - MongoDB does not support transactions across 
multiple documents, which may be a limitation in certain scenarios requiring strict transactional 
consistency.
Memory Usage - MongoDB can be memory-intensive, especially when dealing with large 
datasets, and may require sufficient system resources for optimal performance.
Learning Curve for Developers New to NoSQL - Developers accustomed to relational 
databases may experience a learning curve when adapting to the NoSQL and documentoriented paradigm.
Not Suitable for All Use Cases - While MongoDB is well-suited for certain use cases, it may 
not be the best choice for applications with complex relational data and heavy transactional 
requirements.

LEARNING OUTCOMES : -
• In this experiment , we learnt about different database management systems.
• Learnt about the features and advantages and disadvantages about different DBMS 
like MySQL , Oracle, SQL server , MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
